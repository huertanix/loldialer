loldialer!

loldialer is a project devised by David H at HeatSync Labs to create a means to troll people's phones with Arduino, Ruby, and Twilio.  Lasers will become involved at some point, as tends to happen in many hackerspaces.

NOTE: This code is currently broken.  Like, this makes the Diaspora Alpha release look like Natalie Portman levels of broken.  Working code is coming soon, but I put what I had out there so I can code on my N900 on the light rail so I can have something to do then now that I've run out of levels on Angry Birds.
