loldialer!
==========

loldialer is a project devised by David H at HeatSync Labs to create a means to troll people's phones with Arduino, Ruby, and Twilio.  Lasers will become involved at some point, as tends to happen in many hackerspaces.

Usage
-----
1. Plug in, dial a number
2. Enter the single-digit ID for the sound clip you picked
3. ???
4. PROFIT!!! 

Install
-------
You must have Ruby 1.8.7 or above installed on a working web server, and also gems and the twiliolib gem in particular.  You must also provide the sound clips in the clips directory.

Configure your MAC, IP, and Gateway address in loldialer.pde to match your own ethernet shield and network configuration.

Hardware required and links to purchase said hardware can be found on the HeatSync Labs wiki: http://wiki.heatsynclabs.org/wiki/Loldialer.

**NOTE:** This is a weapon of mass-trolling.  Like all technology, it is a tool that is only as good or evil or Beyond Good and Evil as the person using it.
