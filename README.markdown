loldialer!
==========

loldialer is a project devised by David H at HeatSync Labs to create a means to troll people's phones with Arduino, Ruby, and Twilio.  Lasers will become involved at some point, as tends to happen in many hackerspaces.

**NOTE**: This code is currently broken.  Like, this makes the Diaspora alpha release look like Natalie Portman levels of broken.  Working code is coming soon, however, I put what I had into the cloud so I can fork and code on my N900 and have something to do on the PHX light rail now that I've run out of levels on Angry Birds.
